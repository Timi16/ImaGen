Image Generator using Stable Diffusion
Overview
This project demonstrates how to generate images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model with Hugging Face's diffusers library. It is designed to run on Google Colab and provides a simple interface for generating high-quality images based on textual descriptions.

Requirements
To use this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
1. diffusers
2. transformers
3. torch
4. Pillow

Notes
GPU Usage: Ensure that GPU acceleration is enabled in your Colab environment for faster image generation.
Model Loading: The Stable Diffusion model may take some time to load, depending on the runtime and available resources.
